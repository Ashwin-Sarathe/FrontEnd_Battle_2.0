## 📁 Pages

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|

## 🖼️ Assets

- Custom animated loader (rectangular L-shaped zoom)
- Placeholder for profile image (upload via GitHub or external host)
- Icons via **Font Awesome CDN**

## 🧩 Known Issues

- If hosted via GitHub Pages, only `index.html` loads by default.
- Loader and navbar are hidden unless JS triggers them via controlled navigation.
- Deep linking to `/about.html` or `/parallax.html` may skip the loader.
- Font Awesome requires internet access to load icons.
