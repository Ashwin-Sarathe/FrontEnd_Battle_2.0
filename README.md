This is a multi-page frontend web project built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It includes a fully styled homepage with animation, a pre-loader transition, a parallax-powered second page, and an "About Me" section with typing effects and social media integration.

## 📁 Pages

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `/index.html` | Main landing page with hero section and floating background boxes |
| `/about.html` | Typing animated "About Me" section with GitHub & LinkedIn icons |
| `/parallax.html` | Scroll-based 2-layer parallax animation demo |

---

## 🖼️ Assets

- Custom animated loader (rectangular L-shaped zoom)
- Placeholder for profile image (upload via GitHub or external host)
- Icons via **Font Awesome CDN**

---

## 🧩 Known Issues

- If hosted via GitHub Pages, only `index.html` loads by default.
- Loader and navbar are hidden unless JS triggers them via controlled navigation.
- Deep linking to `/about.html` or `/parallax.html` may skip the loader.
- Font Awesome requires internet access to load icons.

## 🛠️ Setup & Deployment

1. Clone or download the repo
2. Add your profile image to the correct path or host it externally
3. Replace social media `href="#"` links in `about.html`
4. Deploy via GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify

> Ensure your folder structure supports static file routing  
> (_e.g., use `404.html` fallback for client-side routing if needed_)
